# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do **not** open a public GitHub issue for security bugs.

Send a report to **security@fedimint.org** (this address forwards to the
maintainers listed below) or message **`@elsirion.21`** on Signal.

Please include:

- What the bug is and where it is in the code.
- How to reproduce it, if possible.
- What an attacker can do with it (steal funds, break consensus, leak user
  data, stop the federation, etc.).
- Your name or handle, if you want credit in the fix announcement.

## Encrypted Reports

If the report is sensitive, encrypt it with PGP. Mail sent to
security@fedimint.org goes to both maintainers, so encrypt to **both keys**.

| Maintainer | Email | Key fingerprint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dpc | `dpc@dpc.pw` | `23B8 147B 42EB 74CB 801F F76F 930E AF17 AB8F F29C` |
| elsirion | `elsirion@protonmail.com` | `B3CD FF6F 6D4B 2BE9 EA8B 0020 B300 5E57 1AA3 14DA` |

Both keys are hosted on the Proton Mail key server. To fetch them:

```sh
gpg --fetch-keys 'https://api.protonmail.ch/pks/lookup?op=get&search=dpc@dpc.pw'
gpg --fetch-keys 'https://api.protonmail.ch/pks/lookup?op=get&search=elsirion@protonmail.com'
```

Check the fingerprints against the table above before you use the keys.

Please keep the bug private until a fix is released and federation operators
had time to upgrade.

## Supported Versions

We only fix security bugs in the latest stable release line. Older releases do
not get patches. Run a current release if you run a federation in production.

## Scope

In scope:

- All code in this repository: `fedimintd`, `fedimint-cli`, the client
  libraries, the modules (mint, wallet, lightning, meta) and the gateway.
- Consensus safety, fund safety, user privacy, and denial of service against a
  federation.

Out of scope:

- Bugs in third-party software we depend on (report them upstream, but tell us
  too if Fedimint is affected).
- Attacks that need a majority of guardians to be malicious. The threat model
  assumes fewer than one third of guardians are faulty.
- Test and development setups, such as `devimint`.


## Public Gateway Federation Status

Configured gateways expose unauthenticated HTTP and Iroh `POST
/federation_status` queries for one exact federation ID. The response contains
only finite, detail-free connectivity, Lightning module capability, and
registration-health classes for that ID. It must not reveal the gateway's
federation inventory, guardian identities, balances, route hints, credentials,
or raw errors; `/info` remains authenticated. A gateway that has not completed
mnemonic setup exposes only its setup endpoints.

Registration observations are process-local and cleared when the gateway leaves
the federation. Concurrent results follow attempt begin order so stale work
cannot overwrite a newer logical attempt, and advertised TTL uses monotonic
elapsed time. Status assembly holds the federation-manager read lock only while
capturing one coherent snapshot; do not clone the client solely for this public
query because that would interfere with concurrent leave.

## Experimental Aleph idle gate

`FM_EXPERIMENTAL_ALEPH_IDLE_GATE` is not covered by the normal availability or
traffic-privacy expectations. Enabling it accepts two explicit risks:

- A gate fault can stall consensus. Capability leases, lifecycle fail-open
  paths, and periodic probes are defenses in depth, not a liveness guarantee.
- Removing continuous Aleph cover traffic exposes work timing. Authenticated
  guardians learn which guardian first received local work and how long it
  remains active; transport observers can correlate traffic resumption with
  federation activity. Logs and gate metrics can preserve the same timing.

The gate activates only when all guardians advertise current-session support.
Capability expiry, mixed support, recovery, lifecycle transitions, and probes
restore the normal full-speed creator. A faulty guardian can force that
fail-open state but cannot increase creation beyond the normal rate.
