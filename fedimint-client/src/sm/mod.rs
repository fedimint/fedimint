/// For Fedimint transactions to be private users need to communicate with the
/// federation using an anonymous communication network. If each API request was
/// done in a way that it cannot be correlated to any other API request we would
/// achieve privacy, but would reduce efficiency. E.g. on Tor we would need to
/// open a new circuit for every request and open a new web socket connection.
///
/// Fortunately we do not need to do that to maintain privacy. Many API requests
/// and transactions can be correlated by the federation anyway, in these cases
/// it does not make any difference to re-use the same network connection. All
/// requests, transactions, state machines that are connected from the
/// federation's point of view anyway are grouped together as one *operation*.
///
/// # Choice of Operation ID
///
/// In cases where an operation is created by a new transaction that's being
/// submitted the transaction's ID can be used as operation ID. If there is no
/// transaction related to it, it should be generated randomly. Since it is a
/// 256bit value collisions are impossible for all intents and purposes.
