/// open a new circuit for every request and open a new web socket connection.

/// Fortunately we do not need to do that to maintain privacy. Many API requests
/// and transactions can be correlated by the federation anyway, in these cases
/// it does not make any difference to re-use the same network connection. All
/// requests, transactions, state machines that are connected from the
/// federation's point of view anyway are grouped together as one *operation*.

/// 256bit value collisions are impossible for all intents and purposes.
