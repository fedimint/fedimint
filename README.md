# Minimint

**This is an experimental implementation of a federated Chaumian bank. DO NOT USE IT WITH REAL MONEY, THERE ARE MULTIPLE KNOWN SECURITY ISSUES.**

## Getting involved

If you want to learn more about the general idea go to [fedimint.org](https://fedimint.org/), beyond a high level explanation you can also find links to talks and blog posts at the bottom of the page.

There exist three main communication channels for the project at the moment:
* [FediMint telegram group](https://t.me/fedimint) - high level ideas, questions, cryptography discussions, etc., nothing code related though (to keep it low noise).
* [MiniMint dev telegram group](https://t.me/+uiO1s8gPIBE2YTU0) - code related discussions that aren't a good fit for an issue, getting started, if you have weird compiler errors etc.
* GitHub Issues: Things to fix, planned features, longer term architectural choices, etc. (something you want to remember in a week that would be lost in the noise on telegram)

PRs fixing TODOs or issues are always welcome, it might be a good idea though to discuss more involved changes in an issue first to make sure the chosen approach fits into the bigger picture. Smaller PRs to fix typos, broken links etc. are also very welcome.

To get started with development have a look at the:
* [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) - high-level description of the codebase and design
* [Integration tests](integrationtests/README.md) - instructions on how to write and run the integration tests
* `scripts/final-checks.sh` - checks to run locally before opening a PR
* `scripts/integrationtest.sh` - tests that will run automatically after a PR is opened

Happy hacking!

## Running MiniMint locally

MiniMint is tested and developed using rust `stable`, you can get it through your package manager or from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

MiniMint consists of three kinds of services:
* federation member nodes (`server` binary) which make up the federation and run the consensus protocol among each other.
* a Lightning gateway (`ln_gateway` binary) which acts as a bridge between the federation and the Lightning network allowing users to pay LN invoices with e-cash tokens.
* user clients (`mint-client-cli` binary) that interact with the federation nodes and the gateway

In the following we will set up all three.

### Running bitcoind and lightningd

To test out MiniMint you'll need to run `bitcoind` and (optionally) 2 instances `lightningd` to send and receive via Lightning:

```shell
bitcoind -regtest -fallbackfee=0.0004 -txindex -server -rpcuser=bitcoin -rpcpassword=bitcoin

# optional
lightningd --network regtest --bitcoin-rpcuser=bitcoin --bitcoin-rpcpassword=bitcoin --lightning-dir=ln1 --addr=127.0.0.1:9000
lightningd --network regtest --bitcoin-rpcuser=bitcoin --bitcoin-rpcpassword=bitcoin --lightning-dir=ln2 --addr=127.0.0.1:9001
```

### Generating config

You first need to generate some config. All scripts assume config to be located in a folder called `cfg`. Then you can generate the necessary configuration files as follows:

```shell
cargo run --bin configgen cfg <num_nodes> <federation_ports> <api_ports> <tier1> <tier2> …
```

The placeholders can be filled in as follows:
* **`<num_nodes>`:** number of nodes to generate config for. Should be >= 4 and not too big as the cryptography of the BFT protocol is rather intense and you should ideally have 1 core per node.
* **`<federation_ports>`:** base port for federation internal connections. If it is set to 5000 for example and there are 4 nodes they will use ports 5000, 5001, 5002 and 5003.
* **`<api_ports>`:** base port for the federation node API server which user clients connect to. If it is set to 6000 for example and there are 4 nodes they will use ports 6000, 6001, 6002 and 6003.
* **`<tier1> … <tier n>`:** E-cash token denominations/amount tiers in milli sat. There are different token denominations to increase efficiency so that instead of issuing 10 1sat tokens 1 10sat token can be issued. Generally powers of a base are a decent choice, e.g. powers of 10: 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 10000000 100000000 1000000000 

An example with concrete parameters could look as follows:
```shell
cargo run --bin configgen cfg 4 5000 6000 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 10000000 100000000 1000000000
```

This will both create all the `server-n.json` config files and one `federation_client.json`. The server configs are already complete and can be used to run the nodes. The client config on the other hand needs to be amended with some information about a lightning gateway it can use. For that we run

```shell
cargo run --bin gw_configgen -- cfg <ln-rpc-path> <ln-node-pub-key>
```

The **`<ln-rpc>`** placeholder should be replaced with the absolute path to a c-lightning `lightning-rpc` socket, typically located at `/home/<user>/.lightning/regtest/lightning-rpc` for regtest nodes. If you do not intend to use the LN feature this path does not have to be correct and you will not even have to start the gateway. **But for the client to start we need to add at least a dummy gateway**.

The **`<ln-node-pub-key>`** placeholder should be replaced with the gateway's lightning node pubkey. Once again, you can pass a fake pubkey if you don't want to use lightning (e.g. `030160715ddbe8d4cd68e00fc910d6dac161fcfa457bfef4fd8bb93350cc2966aa`).

`gw_configgen` will both generate the final `cfg/client.json` for clients as well as `cfg/gateway.json` which will be used by the Lightning gateway.

Run the client config and set `ln1` as the gateway. If you don't want to use MiniMint with Lightning, you can skip the first command and hard-code a fake pubkey in the second command (e.g. `030160715ddbe8d4cd68e00fc910d6dac161fcfa457bfef4fd8bb93350cc2966aa`).

```shell
lightning-cli --network regtest --lightning-dir=ln1 getinfo
{
    "id": <ln-node-pub-key>,
    ...
}

cargo run --bin gw_configgen -- cfg "ln1/regtest/lightning-rpc" <ln-node-pub-key>
```

### Running the mints

A script for running all mints and a regtest `bitcoind` at once is provided at `scripts/startfed.sh`. Run it as follows:

```shell
bash scripts/startfed.sh <num_nodes> 0
```

The `0` in the end specifies how many nodes to leave out. E.g. changing it to one would skip the first node. This is useful to run a single node with a debugger attached.

Log output can be adjusted using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable and is set to `info` by default. Logging can be adjusted per module, see the [`env_logger` documentation](https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.8.4/env_logger/#enabling-logging) for details.
###Setting up a channel from LN1 to LN2
If you want to pay invoices later, the node (ln1) you've set as a gateway needs to have a channel to the payee node :

First generate a few hundred blocks to you your regtest `bitcoind` wallet to ensure it has mature coins.

```shell
ADDRESS="$(bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=bitcoin -rpcpassword=bitcoin getnewaddress)"
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=bitcoin -rpcpassword=bitcoin generatetoaddress 200 "$ADDRESS"
```

Send your gateway Ligtning node some funds:

```shell
# Get address from gateway lightning node (we'll call it LN_ADDRESS)
lightning-cli --network regtest --lightning-dir=ln1 newaddr

# Send bitcoin to gateway lightning address
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=bitcoin -rpcpassword=bitcoin sendtoaddress <LN_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT>
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=bitcoin -rpcpassword=bitcoin generatetoaddress 1 $ADDRESS
```

Now you can open a channel:

```shell
# First you have to get the LN2_PUB_KEY ("id" in json)
lightning-cli --network regtest --lightning-dir=ln2 getinfo

# Now you can connect LN1 to LN2
lightning-cli --network regtest --lightning-dir=ln1 connect <LN2_PUB_KEY>@127.0.0.1:9001
lightning-cli --network regtest --lightning-dir=ln1 fundchannel <LN2_PUB_KEY> 0.1btc

# Mine some blocks so the channel becomes active
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=bitcoin -rpcpassword=bitcoin generatetoaddress 10 $ADDRESS
```

### Using the client

Then you can use the peg-in script to deposit funds. It contains comments that explain the deposit process.

```shell
bash scripts/pegin.sh <amount in BTC>
```

Take care to not request too big of a peg-in (depending on your amount tier the smallest representations as tokens might be too big to finish signing in reasonable time) or too small (there is a 500sat fee that needs to be paid). After about 20s your default client in `cfg` should have newly issued coins.

You can view your client's holdings using the `info` command:

```
minimint $ cargo run --bin mint-client-cli --release -- cfg info
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.11s
     Running `target/release/mint-client-cli cfg info`
Jun 15 14:57:22.066  INFO mint_client_cli: We own 14 coins with a total value of 9500000 msat
Jun 15 14:57:22.066  INFO mint_client_cli: We own 5 coins of denomination 100000 msat
Jun 15 14:57:22.066  INFO mint_client_cli: We own 9 coins of denomination 1000000 msat
```

The `spend` subcommand allows to send tokens to another client. This will select the smallest possible set of the client's coins that represents a given amount. The coins are base64 encoded and printed to stdout.

```
minimint $ cargo run --bin mint-client-cli --release -- cfg spend 400000
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.12s
     Running `target/release/mint-client-cli cfg spend 400000`

```

A receiving client can now reissue these coins to claim them and avoid double spends:

```
minimint $ cargo run --bin mint-client-cli --release -- cfg reissue AQAAAAAAAACghgE…
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.13s

```

### Using the gateway

To pay a Lightning invoice using ecash tokens via the gateway we must run the gateway itself:

```shell
cargo run --bin ln_gateway --release cfg
```

Generate a Lightning invoice from LN2, our non-gateway lightning node:

```shell
# Make sure your peg-in created coins of small enough tiers. For now the client is not able to spend without exact change.
lightning-cli --network regtest --lightning-dir=ln2 invoice 100000 test test 10m
```

Have LN2 non-gateway lightning node monitor the payment of this invoice. This command hangs until invoice is paid, so run it in another terminal window. Once paid, it will print out some information.

```shell
lightning-cli --network regtest --lightning-dir=ln2 waitinvoice test
```

Pay the invoice: 

```shell
cargo run --bin mint-client-cli --release -- cfg ln-pay <INVOICE>
```

### Other options

There also exist some other, more experimental commands that can be explored using the `--help` flag:

```
minimint $ cargo run --bin mint-client-cli --release -- --help
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.12s
     Running `target/release/mint-client-cli --help`
