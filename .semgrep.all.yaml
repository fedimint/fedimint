  message: Overwritting existing files is rarely a good idea. Use fedimint-core::util::write_overwrite if you are really sure you want to overwrite existing data or `fedimint-core::util::write_overwrite::write_new` if you don't. Alternatively use `fs::File::options` and express intention explicitly.
