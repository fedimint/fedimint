//! # Lightning Module
//!
//! This module allows to atomically and trustlessly (in the federated trust model) interact with
//! the Lightning network through a Lightning gateway. See [`LightningModule`] for a high level
//! overview.
//!
//! ## Attention: only one operation per contract and round
//! If this module is active the consensus' conflict filter must ensure that at most one operation
//! (spend, funding) happens per contract per round

/// The lightning module implements an account system. It does not have the privacy guarantees of
/// the e-cash mint module but instead allows for smart contracting. There exist three contract
/// types that can be used to "lock" accounts:
///
///   * [Account]: an account locked with a schnorr public key
///   * [Outgoing]: an account locked with an HTLC-like contract allowing to incentivize an external
///     Lightning node to make payments for the funder
///   * [Incoming]: a contract type that represents the acquisition of a preimage belonging to a hash.
///     Every incoming contract is preceded by an offer that specifies how much the seller is asking
///     for the preimage to a particular hash. It also contains some threshold-encrypted data. Once
///     the contract is funded the data is decrypted. If it is a valid preimage the contract's funds
///     are now accessible to the creator of the offer, if not they are accessible to the funder.
///
/// These three primitives allow to integrate the federation with the wider Lightning network
/// through a centralized but untrusted (except for availability) Lightning gateway server.
///
/// [Account]: contracts::account::AccountContract
/// [Outgoing]: contracts::outgoing::OutgoingContract
/// [Incoming]: contracts::incoming::IncomingContract
