# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome, just open an issue or PR if you see something to improve! See our other [communication channels](../README.md#getting-involved) above to coordinate with other contributors!

Please note that all contributions happen under the MIT license as described at the bottom of this page.

## Getting involved

If you want to learn more about the general idea go to [fedimint.org](https://fedimint.org/), beyond a high level explanation you can also find links to talks and blog posts at the bottom of the page.

To get started with development have a look at the:

* [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/issues) - things to fix, planned features, longer term architectural choices, etc.
* [Architecture](architecture.md) - high-level description of the codebase and design
* [Integration tests](../integrationtests/README.md) - instructions on how to write and run the integration tests
* [Scripts](../scripts/README.md) - useful scripts for running the tests and federation

## Areas of Contribution

Below are some broad and general areas of contribution to get you started

* [Fedimint Modules](./architecture.md)
* [Fedimint Database System](./database.md)
* [The Lightning Gateway](./gateway.md)
* [Fedimint Setup UI](./ui.md)
* [Nix Build System](./nix-ci.md)

PRs fixing TODOs or issues are always welcome, but please discuss more involved changes in an issue first. Smaller PRs to fix typos, broken links etc. are also very welcome.

For commits, please use [imperative mood](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3580013/should-i-use-past-or-present-tense-in-git-commit-messages/3580764#3580764).

Happy hacking!
