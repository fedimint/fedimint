### Prerequisites

Fedimint's developer environment is build around the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org). Once setup, you can execute one `nix develop` command to create a completely deterministic development, test and build environment with all required dependencies installed and pinned to exact versions. Detailed setup instructions are available in [dev-env.md](./dev-env.md).

Once you have cloned fedimint and can run `nix develop` as described in [dev-env.md](./dev-env.md), you're ready to setup a federation locally!

### Setting up the federation

Just run the following script, **make sure not to run it inside a tmux window**:

```shell
./scripts/tmuxinator.sh
```
which will set up a complete federation including a lightning gateway and another lightning node inside tmux. The first run can take some time since a lot of dependencies need to be built.

The first tmux screen is one big shell for you to follow the tutorial in. If you want to see the federation, bitcoind and lightningd running you can navigate to the second screen (shown below) by typing `ctrl+b, n` (next) and `ctrl+b, p` (previous). You can scroll through the terminal buffer by first typing `ctrl+b, PgUp` and then navigating using `PgUp` and `PgDown`. To maximize any of the panes type `ctrl+b, z`. 
To end the whole tmuxinator session and terminate all the services which were started type `ctrl+b, :kill-session` and hit `Enter`.

### Using the client

Note as you run commands the mint nodes will output logging information which you can adjust by setting the [RUST_LOG](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/) env variable.

The previous step has already set up an e-cash client with a funded wallet for you. If you are interested in the details take a look at [`scripts/pegin.sh`](../scripts/pegin.sh).

You can view your client's holdings using the `info` command:

```shell
$ fedimint-cli info

{
  "federation_id": "b0d8dc13caff84c3e050a891c06966abfc55874b8173e3523eea323b827e6754270bb975b8693081b903a319c2d33591",
  "network": "regtest",
  "meta": {
    "federation_name": "Hals_trusty_mint"
  },
  "total_amount": 10000000,
  "total_num_notes": 52,
  "details": {
    "1": 2,
    "2": 3,
    ...
  }
}
```

The `spend` subcommand allows sending notes to another client. This will select the smallest possible set of the client's notes that represents a given amount.
The notes are base64 encoded into a note and printed as the `note` field.

```shell
$ fedimint-cli spend 100000

{
  "note": "BgAAAAAAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAwdt..."
}
```

The `validate` subcommand checks the validity of the signatures without claiming the notes. It does not check if the nonce is unspent. Validity will be printed as the `all_valid` boolean.

```shell
$ fedimint-cli validate BgAAAAAAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAwdt...

{
  "all_valid": true,
  "details": {
    "32": 1,
    "128": 1,
    "512": 1,
    ...
  }
}
```

A receiving client can now reissue these notes to claim them and avoid double spends:

```shell
$ fedimint-cli reissue BgAAAAAAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAwdt...

{
  "id": {
    "txid": "9b0ba12ae4295d4c393afee6a0ba7c9b0336ab6243a048265fd837a82a9c9059",
    "out_idx": 0
  }
}

$ fedimint-cli fetch

{
  "issuance": [
    {
      "txid": "9b0ba12ae4295d4c393afee6a0ba7c9b0336ab6243a048265fd837a82a9c9059",
      "out_idx": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### Using the Gateway

The [lightning gateway](../gateway/ln-gateway) connects the federation to the lightning network. It contains a federation client that holds ecash notes just like `fedimint-cli`. The tmuxinator setup scripts also give it some ecash. To check its balance, we use the [`gateway-cli`](../gateway/cli) utility. In the tmuxinator environment there are 2 lightning gateways -- one for Core Lightning and one for LND -- so we add `gateway-cln` and `gateway-lnd` shell aliases which will run `gateway-cli` pointed at that gateway. To get the balance with the Core Lightinng gateway, run `gateway-cln info`, copy the federation id and then:

```shell
$ gateway-cln balance <FEDERATION-ID>

{
  30000000
}
```

Tmuxinator has 2 lightning nodes running. [Core Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning) which is running a gateway, and [LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) which represents an external node that doesn't know about Fedimint. With these two nodes, you can simulate sending into and out of Fedimint via Lightning.

To make an outgoing payment we generate a Lightning invoice from LND, our non-gateway lightning node:

```shell
$ lncli addinvoice --amt_msat 100000

{
   ...
   "r_hash": "1072fe19b3a53b3d778f6d5b0b...",
   "payment_request": "lnbcrt1u1p3vdl3ds...",
   ...
}
```

Pay the invoice by copying the `payment_request` field:

```shell
$ fedimint-cli ln-pay "lnbcrt1u1p3vdl3ds..."
```

Confirm the invoice was paid, copy the `r_hash` field from the `lncli addinvoice` command above:

```shell
$ lncli lookupinvoice 1072fe19b3a53b3d778f6d5b0b...

{
    ...
    "state": "SETTLED",
    ...
}
```

To receive a lightning payment inside use `fedimint-cli` to create an invoice:
```shell
$ fedimint-cli ln-invoice --amount 1000 --description "description"

{
  "invoice": "lnbcrt10n1pjq2zwxdqjv..."
}
```

Have `lncli` pay it:

```shell
$ lncli payinvoice --force lnbcrt10n1pjq2zwxdqjv...
```

Have mint client check that payment succeeded, fetch notes, and display new balances:

```shell
$ fedimint-cli wait-invoice lnbcrt10n1pjq2zwxdqjv...
$ fedimint-cli fetch
$ fedimint-cli info
```
