## Running Fedimint for dev testing

Fedimint consists of three kinds of executables:

* **Federation nodes** - servers who form the mint by running a consensus protocol
* **Lightning gateways** - allows users send and receive over Lightning by bridging between the mint and an LN node
* **User clients** - handles user communication with the mint and the gateway

### Prerequisites

In order to run Fedimint you will need:
- The [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to build and run the executables
- The [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download.html) for managing build and test dependencies

Clone and `cd` into the Fedimint repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:fedimint/fedimint.git
cd fedimint
```

It's recommended to **start all the commands in "Nix dev shell"**, which can be started with `nix develop` command.

### Setting up the federation

Just run the following script, **make sure not to run it inside a tmux window**:

```shell
./scripts/tmuxinator.sh
```
which will set up a complete federation including a lightning gateway and another lightning node inside tmux. The first run can take some time since a lot of dependencies need to be built.

The first tmux screen is one big shell for you to follow the tutorial in. If you want to see the federation, bitcoind and lightningd running you can navigate to the second screen (shown below) by typing `ctrl+b, n` (next) and `ctrl+b, p` (previous). You can scroll through the terminal buffer by first typing `ctrl+b, PgUp` and then navigating using `PgUp` and `PgDown`. To maximize any of the panes type `ctrl+b, z`. 
To end the whole tmuxinator session and terminate all the services which were started type `ctrl+b, :kill-session` and hit `Enter`.

### Using the client

Note as you run commands the mint nodes will output logging information which you can adjust by setting the [RUST_LOG](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/) env variable.

The previous step has already set up an e-cash client with a funded wallet for you. If you are interested in the details take a look at [`scripts/pegin.sh`](../scripts/pegin.sh).

You can view your client's holdings using the `info` command:

```shell
$ fedimint-cli info

{
  "federation_id": "b0d8dc13caff84c3e050a891c06966abfc55874b8173e3523eea323b827e6754270bb975b8693081b903a319c2d33591",
  "network": "regtest",
  "meta": {
    "federation_name": "Hals_trusty_mint"
  },
  "total_amount": 10000000,
  "total_num_notes": 52,
  "details": {
    "1": 2,
    "2": 3,
    ...
  }
}
```

The `spend` subcommand allows sending notes to another client. This will select the smallest possible set of the client's notes that represents a given amount.
The notes are base64 encoded into a note and printed as the `note` field.

```shell
$ fedimint-cli spend 100000

{
  "note": "BgAAAAAAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAwdt..."
}
```

The `validate` subcommand checks the validity of the signatures without claiming the notes. It does not check if the nonce is unspent. Validity will be printed as the `all_valid` boolean.

```shell
$ fedimint-cli validate BgAAAAAAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAwdt...

{
  "all_valid": true,
  "details": {
    "32": 1,
    "128": 1,
    "512": 1,
    ...
  }
}
```

A receiving client can now reissue these notes to claim them and avoid double spends:

```shell
$ fedimint-cli reissue BgAAAAAAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAwdt...

{
  "id": {
    "txid": "9b0ba12ae4295d4c393afee6a0ba7c9b0336ab6243a048265fd837a82a9c9059",
    "out_idx": 0
  }
}

$ fedimint-cli fetch

{
  "issuance": [
    {
      "txid": "9b0ba12ae4295d4c393afee6a0ba7c9b0336ab6243a048265fd837a82a9c9059",
      "out_idx": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### Using the Gateway

First let's have the gateway execute a peg-in so it has an ecash note balance. We can use the same `pegin.sh` script as before, but add an extra parameter to tell it to use the gateway:

```shell
$ ./scripts/pegin.sh 10000 1 # fixme
```

Make a note of the federation id from the previous step, or run `gateway-cli info` and copy the federation id.

Now we can use `gateway-cli` of the node where the gateway plugin is running to get our ecash note balance:

```shell
$ gateway-cli balance <FEDERATION-ID>

{
  "balance_msat": 30000000
}
```

To make an outgoing payment we generate a Lightning invoice from LN2, our non-gateway lightning node:

```shell
$ ln2 invoice 100000 test test 1m

{
   "bolt11": "lnbcrt1u1p3vdl3ds...",
   ...
}
```

Pay the invoice by copying the `bolt11` invoice field:

```shell
$ fedimint-cli ln-pay "lnbcrt1u1p3vdl3ds..."
```

Confirm the invoice was paid

```shell
$ ln2 listinvoices test

{
   "invoices": [
      {
         "label": "test",
         "status": "paid",
         ...
      }
   ]
}
```

Create our own invoice:
```shell
$ fedimint-cli ln-invoice 1000 "description"

{
  "invoice": "lnbcrt10n1pjq2zwxdqjv..."
}
```

Have `ln2` pay it:

```shell
$ ln2 pay lnbcrt10n1pjq2zwxdqjv...
```

Have mint client check that payment succeeded, fetch notes, and display new balances:

```shell
$ fedimint-cli wait-invoice lnbcrt10n1pjq2zwxdqjv...
$ fedimint-cli fetch
$ fedimint-cli info
```
